# Module 2 Project

**By: David Stearns & Cary Mosley**

# Introduction
  
This *linear regression* project takes the setting of a social media marketing company that helps individuals who operate or want to operate an AirBNB business in San Francisco get up and running. The most important part is *pricing*. How does an operator know what to charge? Base it off rent/mortgage? Or do they base it off of an algorithm that can review data from the region and predict prices based on the data? This can be an important tool to use when setting up a business plan to help an operator answer the most important question, *will I be able to make considerable money?*  
  
Our clientele is in the millenial age group. We only work with clients who provide the most popular property and room types.
